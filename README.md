**`Digital Craftsman (Soon to be Programmer/ Developer)`**

I am currently a student learning to code, turning codes </> into reality is one of my dream. Currently learning HTML and CSS language, the Harvard course, CS50 and the GITHUB Foundations by Microsoft. At the age of 17, I began my career early to learn a lot of new things. Sooner I will have my own projects.
